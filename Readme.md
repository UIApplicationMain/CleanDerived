# CleanDerived

Command line utility for removing the derived data and caches from Xcode.

## Installing

Download the project, build it and find the output binary. Then go to the directory and run the following to get it to be a command line function.

```
cp cleanderived /usr/local/bin/cleanderived
```

Now you can type "cleanderived" into Terminal and it will remove those files recursively. Make sure Xcode is closed when you do.
